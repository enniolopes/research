# Mode: plan

Contract: `SKILL.md` governs this run — if the host no longer keeps it loaded in context, re-read it before anything else.

Turn a task into a small, verifiable, bounded plan before any code.

Steps: restate the task; run the Light baseline to reconcile the task against existing repo rules/contracts (`reference/baseline.md`) so the plan can't silently contradict a `CLAUDE.md`/`.claude/rules` rule — the reconciliation outcome renders under `### Relevant files and contracts` (`reconciliation: clean` or the conflicts named, else `NOT RUN + reason` per Core rule 10); identify relevant files, contracts, tests, boundaries; derive the 1–3 axes native to this change's decision space (fill `### Axes`; write "none — trivial" if the change has no decision space) and put scope along them — parametrize over the axis, don't branch per case; define scope + non-goals; classify risk with the skill's vocabulary — **high-risk class** (→ propose, no autonomy) and/or **architecture/product ambiguity** (→ needs human judgment), else routine; define required tests/commands; surface blocking questions — each rendered as a `[DECIDE]` block (SKILL Decisions; kind `rule` or `scope`), non-blocking ones as one line each; when a human answer resolves one with a decision that will recur (a rule or durable intent — not a one-off choice), record it under `### Decided rules` as `<rule> → codify at <surface>` (smallest correct surface — stewardship table, `reference/methodology.md`, read on demand) so the next session inherits a constraint, not a question — a rule Guardian noticed but no human decided is never a decided entry (raise it as a finding or an open question), and a decided rule left uncaptured is caught by the next run's Reconciliation (`reference/baseline.md`) — propose only (Action axis); before emitting `READY` on a revision, (a) quote each previously-open question beside the answer that resolved it — an answer that doesn't address its question keeps it open — and (b) run the quantifier audit (`reference/methodology.md`) on the plan's own Scope and Non-goals: every always/never/only/zero/all claim must hold against every other line of the plan, and the result renders below the Verdict heading (`quantifier audit: pass`, or the failing claim); produce plan + implementation prompt.

## Example

Task: "add CSV export to the invoices table."

```md
### Verdict READY

### Task understanding
Add a "Download CSV" action that exports the currently-filtered invoice rows.

### Risk routine + reason
No high-risk-class surface (no billing mutation, no auth change); read-only export of already-visible data.

### Relevant files and contracts
`src/invoices/InvoiceTable.tsx` (renders rows), `src/invoices/useInvoices.ts` (filter state),
existing `src/lib/csv.ts` (reuse — do not write a new serializer).
reconciliation: clean — no `CLAUDE.md`/`.claude/rules` rule touches exports.

### Axes
row-set → serialized format, owned by `csv.ts` — no per-column branching; the filter state is the single input.

### Scope
Serialize the in-memory filtered rows via `csv.ts`; wire one button.

### Non-goals
Server-side export; new columns; changing the filter model.

### Required tests and verification
Unit test: filtered rows → expected CSV string (incl. comma/quote escaping). `pnpm test --filter invoices`.

### Open questions
none blocking

### Decided rules
none — no human decision this session established a recurring rule

### Implementation plan
1. `toCsv(rows)` in `csv.ts` if missing. 2. Button calls it on current rows. 3. Test escaping.

### Implementation prompt
"Reuse src/lib/csv.ts; export the filtered rows from useInvoices; add an escaping unit test."
